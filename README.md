## Overview

A blogpost exercise from Frontend Mentor. Didn't cause me a whole lot of trouble but definitely got me revisiting some basic concepts about html and css, so i feel very fortunate for this exercise since it was a good for practising and refreshing memory about basic css and html concepts.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Step 1: I first started by reviewing the design image to plan how im going to structure my HTML, CSS and what kind of technologies i should use with css.

Step 2: When i moved onto HTML i first created a container for the card, then i created containers for elements inside the card and then added classes to the elements in need of it.

Step 3: 
When i was done with the HTML i moved onto CSS. I started by making the body element a flexbox, moving the card to the center and added styling to the card and then i added flex to other containers and arranged the content corresponding to the design.

Step 4:
Finally when i was done with the basic layout and some styling i focused on the fonts, sizes of elements and some fine tuning. Thats it!

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This challenge reminded me of basic css and html concepts and repeating is the key to learning.



### Continued development

I also learned that i have to learn more about custom properties in css to use them effectively and i have to plan out more carefully about creating reusable css properties so i wouldn't have to copypaste the same fonts and colors to every element individually.
